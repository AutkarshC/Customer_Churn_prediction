# Predicting churn for a prospective client


During your work as a consulting data scientist, a potential new SaaS client reaches out to you to see what “cool machine learning things” can be done with data they have generated. As part of an initial proof of concept, you are given the task of quickly modeling and deriving insights from 3 CSVs that were obtained from this prospective client.
The outcome that the client is interested in is churn. Customer churn is when an existing customer, user, or subscriber stops doing business or ends the relationship with a company. They would like to see how the different features captured in the supporting datasets affect this outcome, and whether there is any predictive potential. 
For the dependent variable, churn.csv is captured as ‘yes’ or ‘no’, whether the clients left the subscription or not, respectively. The second file, user_info.csv, contains client metadata as categorical (such as city) and continuous (such as age) variables of various ranges. The last file, activity_record.csv, shows each user’s activity log. This log captures how each user has interacted with the subscription software over time.
